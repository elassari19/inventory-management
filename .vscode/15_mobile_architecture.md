# Mobile App Technical Architecture

## Overview

Technical architecture and implementation details for the Expo-based mobile application.

## Technology Stack

- Expo SDK
- React Native
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Expo Router for navigation
- Expo Camera for scanning functionality
- TypeScript for type safety

## Project Structure

```
/mobile
  /app             # Expo Router navigation structure
    _layout.tsx    # Root layout
    index.tsx      # Home screen
    (auth)/        # Authentication routes
    (app)/         # Main app routes
  /components      # Reusable UI components
    /ui            # Basic UI elements
    /forms         # Form components
    /inventory     # Inventory-specific components
    /scanning      # Camera and scanning components
  /hooks           # Custom React hooks
  /services        # API and service integrations
  /store           # Redux store configuration
    /slices        # Redux slices for different features
  /types           # TypeScript type definitions
  /utils           # Utility functions
  /assets          # Images, fonts, and other static assets
  /constants       # App constants and configuration
```

## State Management

- Redux Toolkit for global state
- Redux Persist for offline data persistence
- RTK Query for API data fetching and caching

## Navigation

- Expo Router for file-based navigation
- Tab-based main navigation
- Stack navigation for workflows
- Modal presentations for quick actions

## Offline Capabilities

- Offline data persistence with Redux Persist
- Queue system for offline actions
- Sync mechanism when coming back online
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Camera and Scanning

- Expo Camera integration
- Barcode and QR code scanning
- Image capture for inventory items
- Scanner history and recently scanned items

## Performance Optimizations

- Virtualized lists for large datasets
- Memoization of expensive components
- Lazy loading of screens and assets
- Image optimization and caching

## Security

- Secure storage for sensitive data
- API token management
- Biometric authentication option
- Session timeout handling
