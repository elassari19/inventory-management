# Backend Architecture

## Overview

Technical architecture and implementation details for the Express.js backend services.

## Technology Stack

- Express.js framework
- PostgreSQL for primary database
- DynamoDB for high-speed metadata
- Redis for caching
- Passport.js for authentication
- TypeScript for type safety

## Project Structure

```
/backend
  /src
    /api           # API routes and controllers
      /v1          # API version 1
    /config        # Configuration files
    /middleware    # Express middleware
    /models        # Database models
    /services      # Business logic services
    /utils         # Utility functions
    /types         # TypeScript type definitions
    /migrations    # Database migrations
    /seeds         # Seed data
    /jobs          # Background jobs
    /integrations  # Third-party integrations
    app.ts         # Express application setup
    server.ts      # Server entry point
  /tests           # Test files
  /docs            # API documentation
```

## API Design

- RESTful API design principles
- GraphQL for complex data queries
- Versioned API endpoints
- Consistent error handling
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Comprehensive documentation

## Database Strategy

- PostgreSQL for relational data with tenant isolation
- Multi-tenant database with tenant_id on all tables
- DynamoDB for high-speed settings and metadata
- Redis for caching and real-time features
- Connection pooling for performance
- Query optimization and monitoring

## Authentication and Authorization

- Passport.js for authentication strategies
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Tenant-aware permission checking
- API key authentication for integrations

## Background Processing

- Job queue for asynchronous tasks
- Scheduled jobs for recurring tasks
- Worker processes for CPU-intensive operations
- Retry mechanisms for failed jobs

## Security Measures

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Security headers
- Data encryption for sensitive information

## Monitoring and Logging

- Structured logging with tenant context
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Request tracing
- Health checks and readiness probes
