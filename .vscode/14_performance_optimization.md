# Performance Optimization

## Overview

Strategies and implementations for optimizing system performance across all components.

## Database Query Tuning

- **Tenant-Aware Indexing**: All high-traffic tables (inventory, orders) are indexed using composite keys starting with tenant_id for fast access while preserving isolation.
- **Materialized Views**: Frequently computed aggregates (total stock per SKU per warehouse) are precomputed and refreshed incrementally.
- **Query Plan Analysis**: PostgreSQL EXPLAIN output is used regularly in CI environments to catch regressions in query plans during schema changes.

## In-Memory Caching

- **Hot Lookups**: Redis caches commonly accessed items like product metadata, zone maps, or tenant settings with varying TTLs based on mutability.
- **Per-Tenant Namespacing**: All cache keys are prefixed with tenant_id to prevent cross-tenant data leaks.
- **Write-Through Strategy**: For rapidly changing data (inventory quantities), Redis is updated in parallel with DB writes for fast reads.

## Async Processing & Batching

- **Bulk Import Jobs**: CSV or JSON imports (products, stock counts) are queued and processed in batches to reduce API pressure.
- **Webhook Fanout**: Outbound integrations handled asynchronously with retry logic and DLQs to avoid blocking order workflows.
- **Batch Reconciliation**: Scheduled jobs compare expected vs actual stock across warehouses with minimal runtime impact.

## Rate Limiting & API Hygiene

- **Per-Tenant Throttling**: API Gateway enforces fair use to prevent tenant performance degradation.
- **Response Optimization**: Only required fields returned per endpoint; GraphQL allows minimal data payloads.
- **Pagination Everywhere**: All list endpoints use cursor-based pagination with consistent ordering to prevent deep scans.

## Frontend Performance

- **Lazy Data Loading**: Frontend pulls paginated data and requests details on demand.
- **Static Content Caching**: UI assets versioned and cached at CDN edge locations.
- **Tenant Branding at Runtime**: Frontend pulls tenant-specific branding from cached API to avoid per-tenant builds.

## Real-Time UX Optimization

- **Polling vs. WebSockets**: Most stock and order updates use short-interval polling for better scaling.
- **Push Notifications**: Critical events trigger push alerts to offload urgency from the UI.
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with background synchronization.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Always include tenant_id in all queries
- Use batch operations for bulk changes
- Implement proper pagination in all list endpoints
- Cache frequently accessed, rarely changed data
- Use async processing for non-critical operations
- Optimize large dataset operations with background jobs
